Cost of Weapons and Equipment
Money
Monetary values are usually expressed in gold pieces.  In addition to gold coins, there are coins made of platinum, silver, electrum (an alloy of gold and silver), and copper.  They are valued as follows:
1 platinum piece (pp)	= 5 gold pieces (gp)
1 gold piece (gp)	= 10 silver pieces (sp)
1 electrum piece (ep)	= 5 silver pieces (sp)
1 silver piece (sp)	= 10 copper pieces (cp)
For game purposes, assume that one gold piece weighs 1/10th of a pound, and that five coins will “fit” in a cubic inch of storage space (this isn't literally accurate, but works well enough when applied to a box or chest).
First level characters generally begin the game with 3d6 x 10 gp (unless the GM decides otherwise).
Equipment
This list represents common adventuring equipment at average prices.  Prices and availability may vary.  Weights are expressed in pounds.  Items marked * weigh very little; ten such items weigh one pound.  Items marked ** have almost no weight and should not usually be counted.

Weapon Size
Humans and Elves must wield Large weapons with both hands, but may use Small or Medium weapons in one hand.  Halflings may not use Large weapons at all, and must use Medium weapons with both hands.  Dwarves, due to their stocky, powerful builds, are able to use Medium weapons one-handed and some Large weapons in two hands, but Large weapons more than four feet in length are prohibited (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows).  Some weapons must be used with both hands by design (such as bows and crossbows) but the maximum size limits still apply.
The GM should apply similar limitations to weapon-armed monsters; for instance, kobolds and goblins are similar in size to Halflings, and thus should have similar weapon limits.

Missile weapon ranges are given in feet.  In the wilderness, substitute yards for feet.  If the target is as close as or closer than the Short range figure, the attacker receives a +1 attack bonus.  If the target is further away than the Medium range figure, but not beyond the Long range figure, the attacker receives a -2 attack penalty.

Explanation of Equipment
A Backpack will hold a maximum 40 pounds or 3 cubic feet of goods.  Some items may be lashed to the outside; such will count toward the weight limit but not the volume limit.  A Halfling's backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but costs the same as a full-sized item.
A Candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with dim light extending 5' further.  A normal candle will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.
Chalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin.
Holy Water is explained in the Encounter section.
Iron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.
A Lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim light will extend about 20' further.  A lantern will consume a flask of oil in 18+1d6 turns.  A Hooded Lantern allows the light to be hidden or revealed as the user pleases; in all other ways it performs as an ordinary lantern.  A Bullseye Lantern projects a cone of light 30' long and 30' wide at the widest point, with dim light extending an additional 20' beyond that point.  This type of lantern is generally hooded.
A Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items.  The case will have a water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or bandolier.  A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.
A Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons; for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without being turned to stone.  Mirrors are also useful for looking around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using reflected sunlight.
A Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows.  A Bolt Case is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts.  In either case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles.  The length of a quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases.  The price is the same for all types.
Dry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit, nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad” in less than about a month (if not longer).  Dry rations are generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.
Hemp Rope is ½ inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds.  Safe working load for a rope is normally one-quarter of the breaking strength.  One or more knots in a rope cut the breaking strength in half.  This does not affect the safe working load, because knots are figured into the listed one-quarter ratio.
Silk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less than hemp rope.  The notes regarding rope strength given for hemp rope, above, apply here also.
A Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds or 4 cubic feet of goods.
A Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds or 2 cubic feet of goods.
A pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds or 1 cubic foot of goods (divided evenly between both bags).
Thieves' Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief abilities such as opening locks and removing traps.  These abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may be used at a penalty at the option of the Game Master.
A Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel.  When done correctly, hot sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder, hopefully starting a fire.  The best tinder is a dried piece of prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available.  The time required to start a fire should be determined by the GM according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions, starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a turn.
A Torch sheds light over a 30' radius, with dim light extending about 20' further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns.    Of course, a torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as cobwebs or oil) alight.
A Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such as swords, daggers, and axes.
Wineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine; though generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness environment.  The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid, which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a single day.  If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount.  Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty skin has negligible weight.

Notes Regarding Vehicles
The Crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors and/or rowers needed to operate the ship.  Officers are not counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any casualties will not slow down the ship.
Cargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given in tons.  If the ship sails night and day, each passenger requires living space equivalent to one ton of cargo; in addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy 1/10 of a ton of space.
Movement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see Time and Scale in Part 4: The Adventure for an explanation) as well as miles per day.  The encounter movement of ships is not directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat, and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.
The parenthesized figure represents maneuverability; again, see the Time and Scale section for details.
See Attacking a Vehicle in the Encounter section for details on the Hardness and HP statistics.
A chariot requires a single horse, generally a warhorse, to pull it.  Both coaches and wagons require at least a pair of draft horses to pull them.
A caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or three masts.  Though superficially similar to the larger carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for which the larger ship is ill suited.
A carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or four masts.
Galleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed.  A small galley will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers).  Galleys are generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.
The longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar to the large galley.  However, where more civilized nations have specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship is more generalized; most crewmen will be qualified for all of these tasks.
Siege Engines
These are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes ships.  Their cost may be up to twice as high in a remote location.  A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista, onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the weapon.  Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties, detailed below.  Note:  siege engines are not generally usable against individuals or monsters; the GM may make exceptions for very large monsters like giants or dragons.

Ballista:  This is effectively a very large crossbow that may fire a spear-like bolt or a large stone.  It is usually mounted on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship.  When firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone.  A ballista requires a crew of three to operate.
Battering Ram:  These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of portable roof).  They require a crew of eight or more.
Onager:  This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat trajectory.  An onager requires a crew of four to operate.
Trebuchet:  This mighty weapon uses a counterweight to fling a stone on a high, arcing path.  It cannot fire at targets within 200 yards.  If it is aimed at a target that is more than 20’ higher than the weapon, there is an additional –2 attack penalty.  A trebuchet requires a crew of eight to operate.
